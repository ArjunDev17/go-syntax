You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.
Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.
For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.
Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.
  1
   /\
 2   3
 /\     \
4  5     6 
Root to leaf paths = “124”, “125”, “136”
Ans = 124 + 125 + 136 = 385
