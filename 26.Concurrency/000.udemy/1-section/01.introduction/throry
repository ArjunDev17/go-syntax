Concurrency :
        it is about multiple things happening at same time in randome order .

        Go provides built in support for concurrency.
Why we need to think about concurency ?
in order to run faster application needs to be devided into multipe independet units and run them in parallel

check example :

Concurrency :
it is composition of independent execution computations which may or may not run in parallel

Parallsim
parallism is ability to execute multiple computations simultaeously
                multiple core processor
                core 1---->UI Process
                core 2---->Redering Process
                core 3---->Network Process
                core 4---->Strong Process
        Concurrency enable parallism


What is a Process ?
        an instance of running program is called a process .
        process provide environment for program to execute
