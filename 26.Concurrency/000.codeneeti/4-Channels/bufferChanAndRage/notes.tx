Let's break down how the buffered channel works in the given code example, step by step.

1. Creation of a Buffered Channel
go
Copy code
ch := make(chan int, 5)
Here, a buffered channel of type int with a capacity of 5 is created.
A buffered channel can hold up to 5 values in its internal queue without blocking the sender (ch <- value).
2. Producer (Goroutine Sending Values)
go
Copy code
go func() {
    defer close(ch)
    for i := 0; i < count; i++ {
        ch <- i
    }
}()
This goroutine acts as a producer:
Sends values (i) into the channel ch in a loop (i runs from 0 to count-1, i.e., 8 times).
After the loop ends, close(ch) is called to indicate no more values will be sent.
The channel can only hold 5 values at a time due to its buffer size. If the buffer is full, the goroutine blocks until space is available.
3. Consumer (Main Goroutine Reading Values)
go
Copy code
for val := range ch {
    fmt.Printf("value of ch is :%v\n", val)
}
The range loop iterates over the channel:
Reads values from the channel (ch) one at a time.
Continues until the channel is closed and all values are consumed.
As values are read, space is freed in the buffer, allowing the producer goroutine to continue sending new values.
Key Points of Execution
Buffering Mechanism:

Initially, the producer can send up to 5 values without blocking since the buffer has space.
Once the buffer is full, the producer waits for the consumer to read values.
Concurrency:

Both the producer and consumer work concurrently. The producer sends values into the channel, and the consumer reads them out.
The producer only blocks when the buffer is full, and the consumer only blocks when the buffer is empty.
Channel Closing:

The defer close(ch) ensures the channel is closed after all values are sent.
Closing the channel prevents a deadlock in the range loop because range terminates when the channel is closed.
Output Explanation
With count = 8 and buffer size = 5, the output will display values 0 to 7, as follows:

plaintext
Copy code
value of ch is :0
value of ch is :1
value of ch is :2
value of ch is :3
value of ch is :4
value of ch is :5
value of ch is :6
value of ch is :7
The producer sends values into the channel.
The consumer reads values and prints them.
The process continues until all values are sent and the channel is closed.
Why Use Buffered Channels?
Improves Efficiency:
Allows the producer to send multiple values without waiting for the consumer immediately.
Synchronization:
Automatically handles coordination between sender and receiver with minimal effort.
Avoids Deadlocks:
Prevents blocking in simple cases where the producer can send while the consumer is still busy.

The reason the output displays all values from 0 to 7 (even though the buffer size is 5) is that the buffered channel doesn't limit the total number of values sent, but rather controls how many values can be stored in the channel at any one time without blocking the sender. Let's break it down:

1. Buffered Channel Behavior
A buffered channel of size 5 can hold up to 5 values at a time.
When the channel is full, any additional send operation (ch <- i) will block until there is space available in the channel (i.e., when the consumer reads a value).
2. Producer and Consumer Work Concurrently
In your code, the producer goroutine is responsible for sending 8 values (from 0 to 7).
The main goroutine (consumer) starts reading values from the channel immediately after the producer begins sending them.
This concurrent operation allows the producer to continue sending even after the buffer is full, as long as the consumer keeps reading values and freeing up space.
Step-by-Step Execution
Channel Buffer: Initially empty ([]), with a capacity of 5.
Producer: Sends values into the channel.
Consumer: Reads values from the channel.
Step	Producer Action	Channel Buffer (State)	Consumer Action	Output
1	Sends 0	[0]		
2	Sends 1	[0, 1]		
3	Sends 2	[0, 1, 2]		
4	Sends 3	[0, 1, 2, 3]		
5	Sends 4	[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]		
6	Sends 5 (blocks until space)	[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]	Reads 0 from channel	0
7	Sends 6	[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]	Reads 1 from channel	1
8	Sends 7	[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]	Reads 2 from channel	2
9	Producer finishes, closes channel	[4, 5, 6, 7]	Reads all remaining values	3â€“7

Key Observations
Buffered Channel:

The channel can store up to 5 values at a time, but since the producer and consumer work concurrently, the consumer continuously frees up space in the buffer.
No Value Loss:

Even though the buffer is limited, all 8 values are processed because the producer only blocks when the buffer is full, and the consumer eventually consumes all values.
Closing the Channel:

The producer closes the channel once all 8 values are sent. This signals to the consumer that no more values will be added, allowing the range loop to exit cleanly.
Conclusion
The buffer size (5) controls how many values the channel can hold at one time, but it does not limit the total number of values that can pass through the channel as long as the consumer keeps freeing space. That's why the output displays all 8 values, even though the buffer size is only 5.
